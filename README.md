## General Information
New Gym is my final project for Coderslab Python Developer Bootcamp. It has all functionalities of a commercial workout tracker application. The database, backend and frontend is my original design. The project reflects my passion for strength training and showcase my data analysis skillset.

Feel free to register as a new user and track your own workouts or login as a preview user with just one click. Please bear in mind that the application and database is hosted on render, a free hosting platform and it can take a few seconds to perform an action.


## Technologies Used
- Django 4.1.4 - web framework
- PostreSQL - database
- Bootstrap 5 / MD Bootstrap - frontend library
- Javascript ES6 - frontend engeneering
- Charts JS - data visualization


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Exercises
The exercises menu lets you easily filter through the exercise database based on the equipment you have, muscle you want to train or just by typing the name of the exercise. You can also add you own exercises!
- Templates
You can use one of the built-in workout templates or create your own. Before your workout pick a template and if you have previously used it, the app will automatically upload the last workout data into the form, so you can easily progress
- Analytics
